chem_convention.1.t: "Military Staff Suggests Chemical Warfare"
chem_convention.1.desc: "Our generals and military staff have contemplated to activate our chemical weapon stockpiles. The world has seen what horror these weapons have inflicted upon the world when they were used during the great war, and thus a sizable faction within our army staff raises objection to the use of such weapons.\n\nIf we decide to employ chemical weapons against our enemies in an offensive manner, we won't be able to keep a secret for very long and some more liberal elements of the international community might denounce our us, while some nations might simply not care.\n\nWhile we might be able to evade the ire of other nations, or decide to simply not care, activating our chemical weapons could be a decisive boon for our troops. But we have to keep in mind such action will destabilise the balance of terror between our nations and our rival."
chem_convention.1.a: "Let's not make hasty decisions."
chem_convention.1.a.tt: "Continue the status-quo and let us decide at a later point."

chem_convention.2.b: "How dare they!"
chem_convention.2.c: "We have to put an end to this."

chem_convention.3.t: "Seeking Support of a Major Nation"
chem_convention.3.desc: "While we have a voice in the international community, it would be foolish to claim our voice has the same weight as one of the more powerful nations. We can stomp our feet and demand people to listen, but it many others might simply scoff and continue whatever they are doing.\n\nHowever, if we could get one of the more powerful and influential nations on our side to back our cause, other will have to listen."
chem_convention.3.a: "We will ask the Allies."
chem_convention.3.b: "We will ask the Communists."
chem_convention.3.c: "We will ask the Fascists."
chem_convention.3.d: "There is no one left to ask."

chem_convention.4.t: "[From.GetNameDef] Asking For Our Support"
chem_convention.4.desc: "[From.GetName] has raised concerns about nations employing chemical weapons. They are seeking the support and backing of a major nation in an attempt to get the sovereigns of this world to the table and agree on a ban on chemical weapon usage.\n\nIn 1925 the nations got together and many agreed on the Geneva Protocol; an international agreement and understanding that chemical weapons should never be used again. But clearly, in recent years previous conventions have either been overthrown or ignored, and [From.GetName] wants the nations of this earth to remember what they agreed on a decade ago."
chem_convention.4.a: "We will help [From.GetLeader]."
chem_convention.4.b: "We will not help them."

chem_convention.5.t: "No Help From Major Country"

chem_convention.5.a: "Those fools might have just doomed the world."

chem_convention.6.t: "Convention To Reaffirm Geneva Protocol"
chem_convention.6.desc: "More than a decade after the 1925 Geneva Conference for the Supervision of the International Traffic in Arms, nations from across the world have gathered on the behalf of [CW_convention_holder.GetNameDef] to once again discuss the Geneva Protocol.\n\nWhile it is generally understood that chemical weapons are pure weapons of torment, there are those that still believe that treaties and rules do not apply to them. [CW_convention_holder.GetNameDef] believes that coming together will show once and for all which countries are ready to be part of the international community and work within its rules, and which countries believe they are above this." #\n\nIf everything goes well, some of the more powerful nations might even be convinced to throw their full support behind this new agreement and decide to help enforce the Geneva Protocol.
chem_convention.6.a: "This is a most interesting development."

chem_convention.7.t: "Convention To Reaffirm Geneva Protocol"

chem_convention.7.c: "Refuse to sign."

chem_convention.8.t: "Enforce the Geneva Protocol"
chem_convention.8.desc: "One of the many shortcomings of international treaties is the difficulty to enforce them. As some nations in the recent past have demonstrated, a rule is only as powerful as the punishment that can follow if broken.\n\nSome nations have looked at our country and raised the suggestion if we could not put our weight behind this in the name of international peace.\n\nIf we decide to fully back this treaty with our military might, we will need to intervene if a country decides to employ chemical weapons against a signatory country."
chem_convention.8.a: "A treaty without enforcement is powerless"

This situation has arise, raising with it the question if we shall now answer their heinous attacks with our own chemical weapons."
chem_convention.11.a: "We have to retaliate to chemical weapons being used against us!"
chem_convention.11.a.tt: "For three years, we will be able to employ chemical weapons without breaking our obligations\n"
